/**
 * Custom telemetry registry.
 *
 * k6 requires Trends/Counters/Rates to be constructed in the *init
 * context* — i.e. at module evaluation time, before the default function
 * runs. Lazy allocation inside the VU loop throws:
 *   "metrics must be declared in the init context"
 *
 * We therefore eagerly construct the bundle at module load. Every test
 * file that imports this module triggers init-time allocation, exactly
 * once per VU isolate. `telemetry()` is a thin getter that stays in the
 * public API in case we later want to swap implementations (Null object
 * for dry-run, fake for unit tests, etc.).
